      "Developed hands-on expertise in microfluidic and Lab-on-a-Chip systems by working on microscale fluid dynamics and contributing to the design, fabrication, and testing of microfluidic devices.",
    detailedDescription:
      "I worked as Summer Research Intern at the BioMicrofluidics and Soft Matter Lab, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My project, titled “Development of an Integrated Lab-on-a-Chip Device for the Manipulation of Human Red Blood Cells Under an Electric Field Using Soft-Lithography Techniques”, focused on microfluidic device fabrication and experimental analysis of RBC deformation under electric fields. During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in soft lithography, PDMS preparation, plasma bonding, microfabrication, blood sample preparation (RBC isolation), and microfluidic chip assembly, etc. I worked extensively with inverted microscopy for real-time visualization and developed skills in literature review, experimental troubleshooting, and data interpretation. This internship strengthened my expertise in microfluidics, biomedical device design, and lab-on-chip systems, aligning with my interest in biomedical engineering and applied research.",
