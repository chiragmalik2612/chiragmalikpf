      "Developed hands-on expertise in microfluidic and Lab-on-a-Chip systems by working on microscale fluid dynamics and contributing to the design, fabrication, and testing of microfluidic devices.",
    detailedDescription:
      "I had the opportunity to work as a Summer Research Intern at the BioMicrofluidics and Soft Matter Laboratory, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My project, titled “Development of an Integrated Lab-on-a-Chip Device for the Manipulation of Human Red Blood Cells Under an Electric Field Using Soft-Lithography Techniques”, revolved around the exciting intersection of microfluidics, soft matter physics, and biomedical engineering.\n\nThe aim of this project was to design and fabricate a microfluidic lab-on-chip platform capable of manipulating and studying red blood cell (RBC) deformation under externally applied electric fields. Such devices have applications in disease diagnostics, biophysics studies, and point-of-care biomedical devices.\n\nDuring the internship, I gained extensive hands-on experience in:\n\nMicrofabrication & Soft Lithography\n- Design and replication of microchannel molds using SU-8 photolithography.\n- Preparation and curing of PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) replicas.\n- Plasma bonding of PDMS with glass substrates to create sealed microfluidic devices.\n\nDevice Assembly & Experimental Setup\n- Integration of microelectrodes within microchannels to apply controlled electric fields.\n- Preparation of blood samples through RBC isolation and controlled dilution for experiments.\n- Assembly of the microfluidic device and real-time observation of RBCs under varying electric field strengths.\n\nVisualization & Data Analysis\n- Use of inverted optical microscopy for real-time monitoring of RBC behavior inside microchannels.\n- Recording and interpreting deformation patterns of RBCs under different electric field conditions.\n- Troubleshooting challenges such as bubble formation, channel leakage, and non-uniform electric field distribution.\n\nResearch & Communication Skills\n- Conducting literature surveys on electrorotation, dielectrophoresis, and microfluidic cell manipulation.\n- Preparing structured reports, maintaining detailed lab notebooks, and discussing results with research scholars.\n- Learning how to critically analyze experimental outcomes and compare them with theoretical predictions.\n\nThis internship gave me exposure not only to microfluidic technology and lab-on-chip device fabrication, but also to the practical challenges of biomedical research. I developed skills in experimental troubleshooting, problem-solving, and scientific communication. The project deepened my understanding of how microfluidic devices can act as powerful diagnostic and analytical tools, and strengthened my passion for pursuing research in biomedical device design and applied microfluidics.\n\n(Here, I will be including pictures of the microfluidic chip prototypes, the experimental setup with microscope and electrodes, and snapshots from the laboratory work to visually showcase the project journey.)",
